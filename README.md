# LooseWeightTracker
A web app to loose weight and track your progress over time.

## Introduction 
I am building this app to help people loose weight. In fact, I realized that Weight loss is something that requires perseverence and sticking to the right schedule is very important to keep going. And seeing the progress is important. Thus, this application is intended to help you track your progress over time and have your schedule that you can check up every morning and try to stick to it.

This app, is a web app that can run on any system that has a browser (PC, smartphones, raspberry pi etc).  It does not use the cloud to store your data, all data is stored on your browser, you can export it and send it to another device by yourself.

My objectie that you keep your own data and you are not supposed to share it on the cloud.

Tell me if you like it.
