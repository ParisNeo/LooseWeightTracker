# ShapeTracker
A web app to help you achieve your weight loss goals and track your progress over time.

## Introduction
Are you looking to lose weight and improve your overall health and wellness? ShapeTracker is here to help! This web app, developed by [ParisNeo](https://github.com/ParisNeo) in collaboration with [Assistant](https://openai.com/blog/openai-assistant/), a large language model trained by OpenAI, provides personalized schedules to help you reach your weight loss goals, as well as tools to track your progress over time.

When you first open the app, you will be prompted to select a weight loss plan based on your specific needs and goals. Whether you are looking to lose weight, maintain your current weight, or gain muscle, ShapeTracker has a plan for you. You will also be asked to enter your name, age, and initial weight to help customize your plan.

Once you have selected a plan, you will be taken to the main page of the app. This page includes your schedule for the day, as well as a list input where you can add date-weight couples to track your progress. You can also view a graph that shows your weight evolution over time, and use the links provided to download all of your data as a JSON file or import data from a JSON file.

ShapeTracker is designed with a dark theme and flat buttons, making it easy to use on any device. And, because all of your data is stored locally on your browser, you can be confident that your privacy is protected.
